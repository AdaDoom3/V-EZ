AMD AND ITS LICENSORS WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS OR THIS AGREEMENT EVEN IF AMD AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event shall AMD's total liability to Licensee for all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise) exceed the amount of $100 USD.  

11.3 Indemnification.  Licensee agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless AMD and its licensors, and any of their directors, officers, employees, affiliates or agents from and against any and all loss, damage, liability and other expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), resulting from (a) Licensee’s use, distribution or sublicense of the Licensed Materials, (b)  violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement by Licensee or any sublicensee, or (c) for failure by Licensee to obtain and comply with third party licenses that may be required pursuant to Sections 5, 6 and 7 herein.  

12.	CONFIDENTIALITY. Licensee shall protect the Licensed Materials and any information related thereto (collectively, “Confidential Information”) by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or publication of the Confidential Information as Licensee uses to protect its own confidential information of a like nature.

Licensee shall be responsible for its employees and contractors adherence to the terms of this Agreement.  Licensee may disclose Confidential Information in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order, provided that Licensee either (a) gives AMD reasonable notice prior to such disclosure to allow AMD a reasonable opportunity to seek a protective order or equivalent or (b) obtains written assurance from the applicable judicial or governmental entity that it will afford the Confidential Information the highest level of protection afforded under applicable law or regulation. 

13.	TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL. AMD may terminate the Agreement immediately upon the breach by Licensee or any sublicensee of any of the terms of the Agreement. Licensee may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to AMD and destruction of the Licensed Materials Licensee accessed hereunder.  The termination of this Agreement shall: (i) immediately result in the termination of all rights granted by Licensee to distribute the Licensed Materials and Derivative Works through multiple tiers of distribution under Section 2; and (ii) have no effect on any sublicenses previously granted by Licensee to end users under Section 2(c) and which are compliant with all terms and conditions of this Agreement, which sublicenses shall survive in accordance with their terms. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Licensee will cease using and destroy or return to AMD all copies of the Confidential Information, including but not limited to the Licensed Materials. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, all provisions survive except for Section 2.

14.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  Licensee shall adhere to all applicable U.S., European, and other export laws, including but not limited to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) (15 C.F.R Sections 730-774), and E.U. Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009.  Further, pursuant to Section 740.6 of the EAR, Licensee hereby certifies that, except pursuant to a license granted by the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security or as otherwise permitted pursuant to a License Exception under the EAR, Licensee will not (1) export, re-export or release to a national of a country in Country Groups D:1, E:1 or E:2 any restricted technology, software, or source code it receives from AMD, or (2) export to Country Groups D:1, E:1 or E:2 the direct product of such technology or software, if such foreign produced direct product is subject to national security controls as identified on the Commerce Control List (currently found in Supplement 1 to Part 774 of EAR).
