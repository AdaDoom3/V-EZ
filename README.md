# V-EZ

V-EZ is a middleware layer for the Vulkan API that lowers the barrier to entry for developers. The required low-level knowledge of GPU hardware and behavior in Vulkan is much greater than OpenGL and V-EZ attempts to bridge that gap by augmenting the Vulkan API to allow for usage and semantics on par with OpenGL while retaining the power and flexibility afforded by Vulkan.

## Build Requirements

* Windows only (cross-platform coming in future releases)
* Visual Studio 2015 and later

## Hardware Support

V-EZ is not hardware vendor specific and should work on non-AMD hardware.
